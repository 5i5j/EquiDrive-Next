# Gemini Development Log: The Greenfield Rebirth

This document records the collaborative journey between the Architect (User) and Gemini (AI) in developing EquiDrive-Next.

## 📝 Milestone: 2026-01-15 (The First Ignite)

### 1. Architectural Pivot
- **From Displacement to Heading**: Shifted intent labeling logic from V1's "3.5m lateral displacement" to V2's "Heading Delta (Angular change)". This captures the physics of turning more accurately regardless of road orientation.
- **Environment Isolation**: Configured `tf_gpu` conda environment on P620 workstation, leveraging RTX 3080 Ti for acceleration.

### 2. Engineering Breakthroughs
- **Data Normalization**: Implemented a "Relative to Origin" transform, setting the vehicle's position at T=0 as (0,0) and aligning its initial heading.
- **Module System**: Resolved Python import issues by establishing a proper `src` package structure with `__init__.py` and `PYTHONPATH` management.

### 3. Training Results (Baseline V1)
- **Dataset Size**: Scaled from 1,000 to 10,000 samples.
- **Validation Accuracy**: Achieved a stable **91.4%**, demonstrating excellent generalization with low overfitting gap.
Samples	Train Acc	Val Acc	Loss	Status
1,000	91.8%	85.0%	0.24	Overfitting Detected ⚠️
10,000	93.3%	91.4%	0.20	Stable & Robust ✅

### 4. Future Roadmap
- **V2 Feature Engineering**: Incorporate velocity ($v_x, v_y$) and yaw rate ($\omega$) to resolve intent ambiguity in slow-moving scenarios.
- **Full-scale Training**: Unleash the pipeline on the complete 238k AV2 dataset.

## 📝 Milestone: 2026-01-15 (The V2 Symmetry Breakthrough)

### 1. The "Category" Mystery & Resolution
- **Issue**: Encountered `KeyError: 'category'` during data processing.
- **Root Cause**: Identified that Argoverse 2 data schema uses `object_category` instead of `category`, and requires `focal_track_id` for agent identification.
- **Fix**: Re-engineered the `builder_bronze.py` to use `df['track_id'] == df['focal_track_id']` for precise agent filtering.

### 2. Strategic Pivot: Class Balancing
- **Action**: Implemented a "Quota-based" extraction logic.
- **Result**: Successfully curated a 6,000-sample dataset with a perfect **2000:2000:2000** split for Left, Right, and Straight intents. This removed the "Straight Bias" present in earlier iterations.

### 3. Feature Engineering Evolution
- **Upgrade**: Successfully transitioned from 2D coordinates to 4D kinematic states (Position + Velocity).
- **Impact**: The model now recognizes "Turn Intent" earlier by observing deceleration patterns in velocity components, leading to a much lower training loss ($0.14$).

### 4. GPU Performance
- **Hardware**: Leveraged NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti.
- **Efficiency**: 50 Epochs completed in record time with stable convergence.
